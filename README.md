# Overview
This repo contains an example of how to create a Tenant in vCloud director. This example is customized for my own use case. However we can use this as a template and customized according to your environment.

## Below are few Customization to have user enter few inputs as possible

### Codifying the naming conventions and autoselecting the variables.
User only has to enter the Customer name and "tenant_type". "tenant_type" is used for two things 
1. Generate the names for ORG, VDC, Edge and ORG network
2. This "tenant_type" value also maps to   "Provider VDC", "vCenterCenter", network pool, storage profile and cpu speed ( we used two different cpu speed 1000 mhz and 2000 mhz for different tenan_type). You can see this mapping in variables.tf. You can call this mapping or autoselecting the variables based on a single value.

## Names generation locals variables:
locals {
  org_name = "${var.cust_name}-${substr(var.tenant_type, 0, 3)}"
}

locals {
  vdc_name = "${var.cust_name}-${var.tenant_type}-VDC01"
}
locals {
  edge_name = "${var.cust_name}-${var.tenant_type}-EG01"
}

## Mapping Variables :

variable "pvdc_list"
variable "cpuspeed_list" 
variable "nwpool_list" 
variable "vc_list"
variable "sp_list" 
variable "csp_list"
